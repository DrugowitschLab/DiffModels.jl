Content
-------

The library provides Julia classes and functions to define diffusion models, sample their first-passage times and boundaries, and compute their first-passage time density functions. For now, only diffusion models with two absorbing boundaries are supported. The library supports time-changing boundaries and drifts.

The diffusion models assume a drifting and diffusing particle *x(t)* that starts at *x(0) = 0*and whose time-course follows

*dx = mu(t) dt + sig(t) dW* ,

where *mu(t)* is the current drift, *sig(t)* is the current diffusion standard deviation (for now assumed to be *sig(t)=1*, always), and *dW* is a Wiener process. Diffusion is terminated as soon as the particle reaches either the upper boundary *theta_u(t)* or lower boundary *theta_t(t)*. The library requires *theta_u(0) > 0* and *theta_l(0) < 0*. The time at which either boundary is reached is the first-passage time. The associated densities, *g_u(t)* and *g_l(t)*, are the joint densities over bounds and first-passage times, such that

*integral_0^infinity (g_u(t) + g_l(t)) dt = 1* .

The library provides specialised classes for time-invariant drifts, *mu(t) = mu_0* for all *t*, time-invariant bounds, *theta(t) = theta_0* for all *t*, symmetric bounds, *theta_l(t) = - theta_u(t)* (see below).

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install DiffModels.jl is by using the Julia Package Manager at the Julia Pkg prompt:
```
pkg> add https://github.com/DrugowitschLab/DiffModels.jl
```

Usage
-----

The library is based on assembling diffusion models from drift and boundary specifications. If not constant, all drifts/boundaries are specified by vectors in time steps of *dt*, with the first vector element corresponding to *t=0*. In most cases, these vectors need to be sufficiently long to cover the whole time of relevance. The first-passage times cannot computed beyond this time, and samples cannot be drawn after it. This restriction does not apply to time-invariant drifts/bounds, which do not feature this limitation.

### Drift

The available drifts are defined in [src/drift.jl](src/drift.jl). All drifts are based on the abstract base class `AbstractDrift`. The following constructors are available:
```Julia
ConstDrift(mu::Real, dt::Real)
VarDrift(mu::Vector{Float64}, dt::Real)
VarDrift(mu::Vector{Float64}, dt::Real, maxt::Real)
```
`ConstDrift` is a constant drift of size `mu`. `dt` needs to be nonetheless specified, to evaluate the step size for diffusion model sampling. `VarDrift` is a drift that changes over time according to the `mu` vector that specifies this drift in steps of `dt`. If `maxt` is given, the `mu` vector is extended by repeating its last element until time `maxt`.

### Boundaries

The available boundaries are defined in [src/bound.jl](src/bound.jl). Single boundaries are based on the abstract base class 'AbstractBound'. For such boundaries, the following constructors are available:
```Julia
ConstBound(b::Real, dt::Real)
LinearBound(b0::Real, bslope::Real, dt::Real)
VarBound(b::Vector{Float64}, bg::Vector{Float64}, dt::Real)
VarBound(b::Vector{Float64}, dt::Real)
```
`ConstBound` is a constant boundary at `b`. `LinearBound` is a linearly changing boundary that, at time `t` is located at `b0 + t * bslope`. `VarBound` is a time-varying boundary that changes over time according to the vector `b` in steps of `dt`. `bg` is its time derivative, and needs to contain the same number of elements as `b`. If not specified (last constructor), it is estimated from `b` by finite differences.

Boundary pairs are based on the abstract base class `AbstractBounds`. For such pairs, the following constructors are available:
```Julia
SymBounds(b::T) where T <: AbstractBound
typealias VarSymBounds SymBounds{VarBound}
typealias LinearSymBounds SymBounds{LinearBound}
typealias ConstSymBounds SymBounds{ConstBound}

AsymBounds(upper::T1, lower::T2) where {T1 <: AbstractBound, T2 <: AbstractBound}
VarAsymBounds AsymBounds{VarBound, VarBound}
ConstAsymBounds AsymBounds{ConstBound, ConstBound}

typealias ConstBounds Union(ConstSymBounds, ConstAsymBounds)
```
`SymBounds` and `AsymBounds` specify symmetric boundaries (around zero) and asymmetric boundaries, respectively. `SymBounds` needs to be constructed with the upper boundary, and the lower boundaries is mirrored around zero. `AsymBounds` is constructed with two boundaries, where `upper` is the upper boundary, and `lower` is the *negative* lower boundary.

### First-passage time densities

In the most general case, the first-passage time densities are computed by
```Julia
pdf(d::AbstractDrift, b::AbstractBounds, tmax::Real)
```
This function returns the vectors `g1` and `g2` that contain the densities for the upper and the lower boundary, respecively, in steps of `dt` (as specified by drift and bounds) up to time `tmax`.

For some combination of constant drifts and constant boundaries, significantly more efficient functions are available:
```Julia
pdf(d::ConstDrift, b::ConstBounds, tmax::Real)
pdfu(d::ConstDrift, b::ConstBounds, t::Float64)
pdfl(d::ConstDrift, b::ConstBounds, t::Float64)
pdful(d::ConstDrift, b::ConstBounds, t::Float64)
```
`pdf` returns two vectors, `g1` and `g2`, as before. `pdfu` and `pdfl` compute the first-passage time density at the upper and lower boundary, respecively, only at time `t`. `pdful` returns both densities for this time.

### Drawing first-passage time and boundary samples

Diffusion model sampling is based on the `Sampler` framework from [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl). The basic idea to is create a sampler `s` from a drift/boundary specification, on which `rand(s)` is called. All calls to `rand(s)` return a `t, bound` pair, where `t` is the first-passage time, and `bound` is `true` if the upper boundary was reached, and `false` otherwise. Currently, the following samplers exist:
```Julia
sampler(d::AbstractDrift, b::AbstractBounds)
sampler(d::ConstDrift, b::ConstSymBounds)
sampler(d::ConstDrift, b::ConstAsymBounds)
```
The first sampler is a generic diffusion model sampler that draws samples by simulating full trajectories in steps of `dt`. All samples beyond the time that the drift/bound are specified return `t = Inf` and a random `bound`. The other samplers use a specialised and significantly faster method, based on rejection sampling.

In general, the library computes the first-passage time densities by finding the solution to an integral equation, as described in

For constant drift and bounds, it instead uses a much faster method, based on an infinite series expansion of these densities, as described in

Samples are in the most general case drawn by simulating trajectories by the Eulerâ€“Maruyama method. For diffusion models with constant drift and (symmetric or asymmetric) boundaries, the following significantly faster method based on rejection sampling is used:
